## What is this?

This is a personal-use, demonstration project created in an afternoon to help elementary school kids who are curious about more complex
software development, without (hopefully) being to overwhelming. Created as a prop piece for my 7 mins during career day.

I imagine I have failed spectacularly here. The goals were to not let my experience get in the way of writing the most clear code,
even if it's not the "best" code.

PRs welcome, just make sure it's not optimizations that can't easily be explained to new programmers who won't be able to vote for a long time.
